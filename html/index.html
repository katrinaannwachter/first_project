    <p>
        A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater
        including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles); struck, scraped; or struck against another similar
        instrument. The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments,
        following the human voice.

    <p>
        String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from
        vibrating strings. In most string instruments, the vibrations are transmitted to the body of the
        instrument, which also vibrates, along with the air inside it. In the Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical
        instrument classification, used in organology, they are called chordophones. Common instruments in the
        string family include the violin, guitar, sitar, electric bass, viola, cello, harp, double bass, rebab,
        banjo, mandolin, ukulele, and bouzouki.

    <p>
        A wind instrument is a musical instrument that contains some type of resonator (usually a tube), in which
        a column of air is set into vibration by the player blowing into (or over) a mouthpiece set at the end of
        the resonator. The pitch of the vibration is determined by the length of the tube and by manual
        modifications of the effective length of the vibrating column of air. In the case of some wind
        instruments, sound is produced by blowing through a reed; others require buzzing into a metal mouthpiece.
